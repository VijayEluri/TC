To use the visualizer for testing your solution locally, you'll have to adopt your solution to read 
the parameters from standard in and write the output to standard out. 
This doesn't affect the functioning of the solution you submit to our server.
<br><br>


Your program should first read the number of elements in <b>points</b> N. After this it should read N elements of <b>points</b>, one per line.
Finally, <b>sidesDiff</b> and <b>radiiDiff</b> follow, each in a separate line. After the calculations are done, print the number of elements
in your return, followed by elements themselves, one per line.
Finally, flush standard out.
<br><br>

To do this, you should implement the following pseudocode:
<pre>    N = int(readLine())
    for (i=0; i &lt; N; i++)
        points[i] = int(readLine())
    sidesDiff = int(readLine())
    radiiDiff = int(readLine())
    
    ret = choosePolygons(points, sidesDiff, radiiDiff)
    printLine(ret.size())
    for (i=0; i &lt; ret.size(); i++)
        printLine(ret[i])
    flush(stdout)
</pre>

To run the tester with your solution, you should run:
<pre>java -jar Tester.jar -exec "&lt;command&gt;" -seed &lt;seed&gt;</pre>

Here, &lt;command&gt; is the command to execute your program, 
and &lt;seed&gt; is seed for test case generation.
Additionally you can use the following options:
<ul><li>
-vis to turn on visualization.
</li><li>
-nostrict to allow score to be calculated even if some of your polygons are invalid. The default behaviour (when this
option is absent) is exactly as written in the problem statement, i.e., you score will be 0 if at least one of your
polygons is invalid. If this option is present, the score will be calculated only based on valid polygons; if there
are any invalid polygons, they will just be ignored for the purpose of score calculation.
</li><li>
-manual to allow editing the polygons by hand. If combined with -exec option, you will be able to edit the polygons your
solution returns; otherwise you will have to create all polygons from the scratch. To create a new polygon, click on any
unused point and proceed to editing it. To edit an existing one, select it by clicking on any point
it contains. When editing a polygon, it will be highlighted in blue color; the last vertex will have a lighter color than
the other ones. You can add a vertice to the polygon after its last vertice by clicking any unused point, or delete the last vertice by
clicking on it. You can't edit vertices except for the last one. To delete the polygon you're editing, click "Del Poly" button. To add
the polygon you're editing to the list of polygons, click "Add Poly" button. This will validate the polygon, add it to the list of polygons if
it is valid, or print error message if it is not. Once you're happy with the polygons you have, click "Submit" button.
</li><li>
-debug to turn on extra information for manual mode: detailed reports on polygons editing and points indices on the image.
</li></ul>
Finally, you can print any debug information of your solution to standard error, 
and it will be forwarded to the standard out of the tester.

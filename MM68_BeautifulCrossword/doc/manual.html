To use the offline tester for testing your solution locally, you'll have to adopt your solution to read 
the parameters from standard in and write the output to standard out. 
This doesn't affect the functioning of the solution you submit to our server.
<br><br>

Your program should first read the size of the board <b>N</b>,
followed by the number of words <b>W</b> and <b>W</b> elements of <b>words</b>.
Finally, exactly 4 elements of <b>weights</b> should be read. Each variables is printed in a separate line.

After reading these variables output your return from <b>generateCrossword</b>.
Remember to flush standard output after writing to it.
<br><br>

To do this, you should implement the following pseudocode:
<pre>    N = int(readLine())
    W = int(readLine())
    for (i=0; i&lt;W; i++)
        words[i] = readLine()
    for (i=0; i&lt;4; i++)
        weights[i] = int(readLine())
    ret = generateCrossword(N, words, weights)
    for (i=0; i&lt;N; i++)
        printLine(ret[i])
    flush(stdout)
</pre>

To run the offline tester with your solution, you should execute:
<pre>java -jar Tester.jar -exec "&lt;command&gt;" -seed &lt;seed&gt;</pre>

Here, &lt;command&gt; is the command to execute your program, 
and &lt;seed&gt; is seed for test case generation.
<br><br>
Please note that the tester reads the dictionary from the file "words.txt". Therefore, in order for the tester to work properly,
please make sure to put the appropriate dictionary into "words.txt" file located in the directory from which you run the tester.
You can download the dictionary that we will use to test your
solution <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/contest/problem/BeautifulCrossword/words.zip">here</a>. You can also put some custom dictionary
into "words.txt" (for example, for debugging purposes). 
<br><br>
Finally, you can print any debug information of your solution to standard error, 
and it will be forwarded to the standard out of the visualizer.

(it is devoted to visualizers, but there's almost no difference from usage point of view).
